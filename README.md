# ðŸš€ Space Shooter â€” Terminal Edition

Pilot a tiny ship through a storm of asteroids â€” all in your terminal.
Built in C++ with a clean OOP core, ANSI tricks, and a stubbornly retro vibe. Fast to compile, nicer to play.

Think of this as arcade minimalism: big feelings, small pixels.

# âœ¨ Highlights

Terminal-first gameplay â€” works best in a real terminal (WSL, gnome-terminal).
OOP design: SpaceShip, Asteroid, Bullet, Game etc. â€” easy to extend.
Controls: Arrow keys or WASD to move, Space to shoot.
HUD: hearts (HP) and battery-style energy blocks (visual spacing preserved).
Lightweight animations: explosion, score, and tidy game-over / replay flow.
R to replay, Q to quit from the end screen.
Minimal dependencies â€” only a modern C++ compiler (C++17+) and a terminal that supports ANSI.
